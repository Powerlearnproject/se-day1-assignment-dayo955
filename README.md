Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The study of hardware components
b) The process of designing, developing, and maintaining software
c) The analysis of networking protocols
d) The management of data storage systems
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) development of programming language 2) the establishment of software engineering as a descipline in the 1960s 3) the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) requirement- gathering and documenting user need and system requirement 2) design- creating high level design and detailed design of the high level achiteture and user interface 3) implementation- writing code build the software according to the design specification. 4) testing- conducting various test to ensure the software meet quality standard and functional requirement. 5) deployment- release the software for users or customer 6) maintenance- provide ongoing support,update,and enhancement to the software after deployment
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and where changes are minimal, offering a structured approach with clear phases and documentation. Agile, on the other hand, is ideal for projects where requirements may change frequently, focusing on flexibility, iterative progress, and continuous improvement.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1) software developer- is reponsible for writing code and implementing software solution 2) quality assurance engineer- its ensure software quality by designing and execute test plan 3) project manager- oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software project.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES are software suite that provide conprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. example are visual studio, eclipse
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to sourse code and cordinating work among team members.examples are git, subversion
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1, changing requirement 2, tight deadlines 3, technical debt. Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit- Testing individual units or components of the software to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
integration- Testing the interactions between integrated units or components to ensure they work together correctly.
system- Testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
acceptance- Testing conducted to determine whether the system satisfies the business requirements and whether it is ready for delivery.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
instead of saying what is today weather, you have to be specific by saying "what is weather forcast for lagos nigeria today" its effective because its clear, specific and consice.
